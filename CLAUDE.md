# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Chordy is a JUCE C++17 audio plugin for chord voicing and progression practice with spaced repetition and tempo-based drilling. It receives MIDI input, displays a keyboard visualization, identifies chords, lets users record voicings and chord progressions into personal libraries, and practice them across all 12 keys with timed or untimed modes. Includes a built-in piano synth for audible playback. Targets VST3, AU, and Standalone on macOS. Company: "JezzterInc".

## Build Commands

```bash
make build    # cmake -B cmake-build && cmake --build cmake-build
make run      # build + open Standalone app
```

Build-specific format:
```bash
cmake --build cmake-build --target Chordy_VST3
cmake --build cmake-build --target Chordy_AU
cmake --build cmake-build --target Chordy_Standalone
```

Artifacts: `cmake-build/Chordy_artefacts/Standalone/Chordy.app` (and VST3/AU equivalents).

`COPY_PLUGIN_AFTER_BUILD=TRUE` auto-installs built plugins to system directories.

## JUCE Dependency

JUCE is included as a **git submodule** at `./JUCE/` via `add_subdirectory(JUCE)`.

### Source Files (all in `Source/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PluginProcessor.h/.cpp` | Audio/MIDI processing hub. Owns `MidiKeyboardState`, APVTS, `VoicingLibrary`, `ProgressionLibrary`, `ProgressionRecorder`, `SpacedRepetitionEngine`, `TempoEngine`, `ChordySynth`. Lock-free note sharing via atomic bitfield. Preview MIDI injection via SpinLock+MidiBuffer. Progression playback engine (sample-accurate chord injection). |
| `PluginEditor.h/.cpp` | Top-level GUI. Hosts keyboard, chord display, tabbed library panel (Voicings/Progressions/Melodies), practice panel. 60Hz timer drives chord detection, recording, practice, playback cursor, beat indicator, voicing preview, and live stats refresh. Tab-change detection clears selections. |
| `ChordyTheme.h` | Header-only constants namespace — all colors, font sizes, spacing, corner radii, chart colors. Every visual value lives here. |
| `ChordyLookAndFeel.h/.cpp` | Custom `LookAndFeel_V4` subclass. Flat rounded buttons, pill toggles, thin-track sliders, underline tabs. Avenir Next font. |
| `ChordySynth.h/.cpp` | Built-in piano synth. 2-operator FM synthesis (carrier + modulator at 1:1 ratio) with velocity-sensitive dynamics, pitch-dependent decay, and an octave partial for brightness. 12-voice polyphony. Renders additively in `processBlock()`. Enabled by default. |
| `TempoEngine.h/.cpp` | Audio-thread tempo engine. Internal BPM clock with optional DAW sync. Metronome click (sine burst). Beat position via atomics. Challenge timing API. |

### MIDI Data Flow

```
processBlock() [AUDIO THREAD]
  └─ keyboardState.processNextMidiBuffer() → bridges to GUI
  └─ Scan isNoteOn() for 128 notes → write to atomic bitfield
  └─ If notes active: update lastPlayedNotes (mutex-protected)
  └─ Forward MIDI to ProgressionRecorder if recording
  └─ Progression playback: inject chord note-on/off events by beat position
     └─ Update playbackNotesLow/High atomics for keyboard highlighting
  └─ Merge preview MIDI buffer (SpinLock-protected, from GUI thread)
  └─ If synthEnabled: ChordySynth.renderNextBlock() → FM audio
  └─ tempoEngine.process() → advance clock, render metronome click

timerCallback() [GUI THREAD, 60Hz]
  └─ Read atomic bitfield for live notes
  └─ Chord display (practice override or library match or ChordDetector)
  └─ Clear highlights on tab switch (tab-change detection)
  └─ Keyboard highlighting during progression playback (from playbackNotes atomics)
  └─ Update voicing + progression recording state machines
  └─ Progression panel timer (count-in beats, playback cursor, chord preview note-offs)
  └─ Practice update (voicing or progression, timed or untimed)
  └─ Refresh stats charts live during practice
  └─ Voicing preview auto-off (frame counter)
  └─ Beat indicator update
```

### Built-in Synth (ChordySynth)

- **Architecture**: `juce::Synthesiser` with 12 `ChordyVoice` instances + 1 `ChordySound`
- **Sound**: 2-operator FM. Carrier at note frequency, modulator at 1:1 ratio (warm fundamental modulation). Octave partial (2x freq) for brightness.
- **Envelopes**: Percussive piano — no sustain. Pitch-dependent decay (2.5s bass → 1.0s treble). Mod envelope decays faster than amplitude (bright attack → pure tone).
- **Velocity**: Square root curve at 50% level. Harder hits = more FM modulation sustain.
- **APVTS params**: `synthEnabled` (bool, default true), `synthVolume` (float 0-1, default 0.7)
- **Preview MIDI**: GUI thread injects via `addPreviewMidi()` → SpinLock buffer → merged in processBlock. Used for voicing click preview, chord click preview, and Play button in practice.
- **Voicing preview**: Click voicing in library → green keyboard highlights + synth plays for ~0.5s. Bypasses keyboardState (no flash). Notes auto-release via frame counter.

### Progression Playback Engine

- **Start**: `startProgressionPlayback(prog)` copies progression, resets beat counter, turns on metronome, resets beat position to sync with beat 1
- **processBlock**: advances `playbackSamplePos`, computes beat position, finds current chord, injects note-on/off at correct sample offsets. Updates `playbackNotesLow/High` atomics for GUI keyboard highlighting.
- **Stop**: `stopProgressionPlayback()` sends note-offs via preview MIDI, clears atomics, turns off metronome.
- **GUI**: chart cursor follows beat position (60Hz updates), keyboard shows current chord notes in green.

### Progression Recording Flow

1. **Idle** → Click Record
2. **CountIn** → Metronome starts, beat position resets. Shows "4... 3... 2... 1..." synced to metronome beats.
3. **Recording** → `ProgressionRecorder.processBlock()` captures MIDI with beat timestamps. Pre-held notes injected at beat 0. Stop button ends recording.
4. **Editing** → Raw MIDI analyzed into chord changes. Quantize to beat/half/quarter. Chart displayed with:
   - Click chord to select + hear + highlight keyboard
   - Edit name, root, quality of selected chord
   - Delete chord (red button)
   - Drag chord edges to resize (snaps to grid)
   - Drag end marker to set progression duration
   - Transpose +1/-1 semitones (regenerates names, plays first chord preview)
   - Play button for full playback with cursor
   - Quantize changes re-snap existing edited chords (doesn't re-analyze from raw MIDI)
5. **Confirming** → Name, Key, Mode form. Pre-fills from existing values when editing. Save updates existing progression (same ID) or creates new.

### Progression Practice

**Untimed mode:**
- Chart displayed with highlighted current chord
- Target label: "Key: Eb — Fm7"
- User plays correct pitch classes → "Correct!" → advances to next chord on note release
- After all chords → quality scored from correct/total ratio → advances to next key
- Next button skips chord (records miss), Play button just plays the sound

**Timed mode:**
- 4-beat count-in, then cursor follows metronome through the chart
- Each chord scored by timing: < 0.5 beats = Perfect (Q5), 0.5-1.0 = Good (Q4), 1.0-1.5 = OK (Q3), 1.5-2.0 = Slow (Q2), > 2.0 = Late (Q1)
- Missed chords (cursor passes without correct notes) = Q0
- Overall quality = average of per-chord qualities
- Shows "Complete! 3/4 chords" with score on key completion

**Transposition:**
- `ProgressionLibrary::transposeProgression()` shifts all chord roots, regenerates display names (including slash bass notes), shifts MIDI notes by semitone offset. Voice leading preserved exactly.

### Practice Modes (Voicing — unchanged)

**Untimed mode:**
- Show root in grey above keyboard → turns green on correct → advances on note release

**Timed mode (4-beat musical cycle):**
```
Count-in:  [1] [2] [3 root shows] [4]
Cycle N:   [1 PLAY!] [2 play] [3 Up next: root] [4 prep]
```

**Custom practice:** 12 key toggles + All/None + Random/Chromatic order.

### Data Model

**ProgressionChord struct:**
- `intervals` (vector<int>), `rootPitchClass` (0-11), `quality` (ChordQuality), `alterations`, `name`
- `linkedVoicingId` (optional ref to VoicingLibrary), `startBeat`, `durationBeats`, `midiNotes`
- `getDisplayName()`: generates from root+quality+alterations, includes slash bass if lowest note ≠ root

**Progression struct:**
- `id` (UUID), `name`, `keyPitchClass`, `mode` (Major/Minor/Dorian/etc.), `chords`, `totalBeats`, `bpm`, `timeSignatureNum/Den`, `rawMidi` (MidiMessageSequence)

**Voicing struct** (unchanged): `id`, `name`, `quality`, `alterations`, `rootPitchClass`, `intervals`, `octaveReference`

**Serialization:** VoicingLibrary, ProgressionLibrary, and SpacedRepetition state all serialized as ValueTree children of APVTS state. Raw MIDI stored as compact "time:byte1:byte2:byte3;..." string.

### Tab System

- Tab 0: **Voicings** → `VoicingLibraryPanel` (fully functional)
- Tab 1: **Progressions** → `ProgressionLibraryPanel` (fully functional)
- Tab 2: **Melodies** → `PlaceholderPanel` (future)
- Tab switching clears keyboard highlights, stops previews, updates practice panel selection

- Formats: VST3, AU, Standalone
- Manufacturer code: `Tap1` | Plugin code: `Chrd`
- `EDITOR_WANTS_KEYBOARD_FOCUS: TRUE`

## APVTS Parameters

| ID | Type | Range | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `practiceMode` | Bool | — | false | Practice mode flag |
| `midiChannel` | Int | 1-16 | 1 | MIDI channel (1-indexed) |

## Theming System

All visual styling centralized — **never hardcode hex colors or font sizes**.

- **`ChordyTheme.h`**: All colors, font sizes, spacing, corner radii, chart-specific colors (`chartGrid`, `chartBarLine`, `chartChordBg`, `chartChordSelected`, `chartCursor`, `chartPassingChord`).
- **`ChordyLookAndFeel`**: Custom LookAndFeel_V4 for all standard JUCE widgets.
- **Font**: Avenir Next via `setDefaultSansSerifTypefaceName()`. Requires `setDefaultLookAndFeel()`.
- **Palette**: Warm charcoal + amber accent. Green=success, red=danger, teal=target, amber=accent.

## Key Development Notes

- Audio thread rules: no allocations, no blocking, no locks in `processBlock()` — exceptions: `lastPlayedNotes` mutex (only when notes active), `previewMidiLock` SpinLock (brief).
- Preview MIDI path (`addPreviewMidi`) bypasses `keyboardState` entirely — no keyboard flash, no interference with practice note detection. Used for voicing preview, chord preview, Play button, progression playback note-offs.
- Progression playback uses its own sample counter + BPM for beat position. Updates `playbackNotesLow/High` atomics for GUI keyboard highlighting (same pattern as `activeNotesLow/High`).
- `ProgressionRecorder.recording` is `std::atomic<bool>` for audio thread safety.
- Tab-change detection in editor timer clears stale selections and updates practice panel type.
- Practice panel's `setSelectedVoicingId` / `setSelectedProgressionId` each clear the other's ID to prevent stale state.
- Quantize changes in the progression editor re-snap existing chords (preserves edits) — does NOT re-analyze from raw MIDI.
- Slash chord detection: if lowest MIDI note's pitch class ≠ root pitch class, append "/BassNote" to display name. Works in both `getDisplayName()` and `transposeProgression()`.
- No test infrastructure exists yet
- Planned future features: melody/lick practice (time-series MIDI), MIDI file import, comping rhythm templates
